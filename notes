Should use Cassandra to scale up messages

Probably with Redis pub sub for streaming new messages

All games' data (for now) will be in postgres
sql-1:
  clash_royale
    players
    player_decks
    decks
    matches
    player_records
    clan_records

Probably should use Redshift or BigQuery for match/deck/etc... data. Though that
likely means dropping knex

Need to:
- get all matches for a user
- get analysis for all matches by that user
  - win rate vs certain cards
  - win rate with deck vs certain cards
- get analysis for matches with a card
  - win rate with deck vs cards / decks

match_data table for json: id(matchId), matchData
match_players: id, playerId, matchId, type, arena, isWinner, score, otherScore
match_decks: id, deckId, matchId, type, arena, isWinner, score, otherScore

- there would be a ton of these. up to 32 * match
match_cards: id, cardId, matchId, type, arena, isWinner, score, otherScore
